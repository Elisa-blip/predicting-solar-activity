# predicting-solar-activity

In this project, done for an Information Theory class, we build a model for solar activity.
We first estimate it by decomposing the dataset with Fourier into 15 different cycles.
We then assume a prior that penalizes larger variances for the errors and use Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling to improve our estimate.
